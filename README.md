# Epitech School Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects developed during my studies at [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu/). The projects cover various programming languages, and concepts that I am exploring throughout my academic journey. <br /> <br />
It also contains some useful specific files exclusive to epitech.

## About

The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning progress and showcase how my skills evolved over time. Some of these projects were written during my early stages of learning, so the code quality may vary.

> **Note:** Some of the projects are no longer maintained. They are kept here for reference and educational purposes.

## Repository Structure

Projects are organized into folders. Each folder typically includes:

- A `README.md` file (if available) with project instructions or descriptions
- Source code
- Any related documents or tests

## Technologies Used

- C
- Makefiles
- Python
- Javascript/Typescript

## A Few Words on Code Quality

These projects reflect a learning phase. Some parts of the code may not follow best practices or may be incomplete. They remain available here as a reference point, to track progress, and possibly to revisit and improve in the future.

## License

This repository is shared for educational and personal reference purposes only. Please do not reuse this code in academic projects (especially for people from Epitech, la moulinette c'est m√©chant).
